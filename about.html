            <h1>Professonal Bio</h1>
            <p>
                As a part-time Scion Coalition Scheme trainee at Netmatters since March 2022, I have been gaining foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS. As my skills developed, I progressed to learning SCSS and undertook my first project: creating a reflection of the Netmatters website by cloning it.

Subsequently, I delved into JavaScript and applied my knowledge to develop my own portfolio website. This project involved creating JavaScript functions for the typing effect on the homepage, mobile menu, and contact form. I also expanded my skill set by learning about WordPress and databases, including how to use XAMPP and create and transfer databases from a local server to a live one (cPanel).

One of my latest projects involved creating a website for a charity shop where I volunteer, WoodGreen Pet Charity. I have a particular affinity for designing websites and take pride in my abilities with HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript. As a continuous learner, I aim to develop my skills further and engage in personal projects in my free time.

Overall, I am a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong interest in design and a desire to continually grow and improve my abilities.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm ex game art design student. My main interest is Artificial Intelligence and in the future I want to work in this field, I also like graphic design, doing 2D art in Procreate, 3D modelling in Maya
                and website building. My adventure with coding started a few months ago when I was looking at the source code of several websites (like Facebook) 
                and was changing some variables, mainly colors, just for fun. I discovered that with no knowledge about coding, I could understand some parts of it.
