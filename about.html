My coding journey began last year when I stumbled upon the source code of several websites, including Facebook, and started tinkering with the variables. Even with no prior coding experience, I found that I could understand some parts of it, and I was hooked!">

            <h1>Professonal Bio</h1>
            <p>
                As a part-time Scion Coalition Scheme trainee at Netmatters since March 2022, I have been gaining foundational knowledge in HTML and CSS. As my skills developed, I progressed to learning SCSS and undertook my first project: creating a reflection of the Netmatters website by cloning it.
                <br><br>
Subsequently, I delved into JavaScript and applied my knowledge to develop my own portfolio website. This project involved creating JavaScript functions for the typing effect on the homepage, mobile menu, and contact form. I also expanded my skill set by learning about WordPress and databases, including how to use XAMPP and create and transfer databases from a local server to a live one (cPanel).
                <br><br>
One of my latest projects involved creating a website for a charity shop where I volunteer, WoodGreen Pet Charity. I have a particular affinity for designing websites and take pride in my abilities with HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript. As a continuous learner, I aim to develop my skills further and engage in personal projects in my free time.
                <br><br>
Overall, I am a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong interest in design and a desire to continually grow and improve my abilities.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Prior to my current training as a web developer, I pursued studies in game art design. Though I have since shifted my focus, my background in design has informed my current interests and skills. My primary passion lies in the field of artificial intelligence, and I aspire to work in this area in the future.
                <br><br>
Beyond AI, I also possess a talent for graphic design and have experience creating 2D art in Procreate, 3D models in Maya, and websites. My journey into coding began a year ago when I began tinkering with the source code of various websites, such as Facebook, and experimenting with changes to variables, including colors. Through this experience, I discovered an innate ability to comprehend aspects of coding, despite my lack of formal training.
                <br><br>
Currently, I am exploring cutting-edge technologies, including the New Bing powered by AI, as well as GPT3.5 (Chat GPT), the platform on which I am communicating with you. My interest in staying ahead of the curve and seeking out innovative solutions drives me to constantly learn and evolve as a developer.
